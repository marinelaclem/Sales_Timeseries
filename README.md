# Sales Time-Series Analysis

## Introduction:
This repository offers a comprehensive time-series analysis of sales data. The primary objective is to uncover underlying patterns in sales and to predict future sales trends using state-of-the-art modeling techniques.

## Key Sections:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Rigorous preprocessing steps ensure the sales data is cleaned, transformed, and optimized for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: A variety of visualizations provide a deep understanding of sales patterns, anomalies, and potential insights.
- **Time-Series Decomposition**: A detailed decomposition of the sales data reveals its core components, including:
  - **Trend**: The long-term movement in the data.
  - **Seasonality**: Recurring fluctuations or patterns over specific intervals.
  - **Noise**: Random variation or "white noise".
- **Modeling**:
  - **SARIMAX**: The Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors model serves as a powerful tool for capturing intricate patterns in the sales data.
  - **Prophet**: As a comparison, Facebook's Prophet model is implemented to provide robust forecasts, especially in scenarios with multiple seasonality.

## Results:

The notebook showcases the effectiveness of both SARIMAX and Prophet in forecasting sales, highlighting their strengths in different scenarios.

## Technologies & Libraries Used:

- **Python**: The primary language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Statsmodels**: Essential for time-series decomposition and SARIMAX.
- **Prophet**: Leveraged for its ease of use and accuracy in forecasting.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Vital tools for crafting informative and insightful visualizations.
